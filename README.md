# Matching-Memory-Project

This Project in Codecademy is about 'react-redux'.
This implementation should help when the application grows and smoother use for User.
The use of useSelector hook and the useDispatch hook and selected functions, to get the state and select the state from any file, only the necessary part,
with the hooks and also re-render the application.

In this project its about a memory game, where you flip cards until you get a match, if you get a match you will get an point and continue and if you fail, you reset the cards, 
but only ones you have not gotten yet.
